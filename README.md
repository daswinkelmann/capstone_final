# 1. Overview

<details>

# 2. UX Design Process

<details>
<summary><strong>User Stories</strong></summary>

Core User Stories (MVP)
As a user, I want to register for an account so that I can securely access my personal task list. Acceptance criteria: A registration form is available, valid details create a new account, and the user can log in immediately after registration.


As a user, I want to log in and log out so that my tasks remain private and secure. Acceptance criteria: Only authenticated users can access the app, login validates credentials correctly, logout ends the session and redirects to the login page.


As a user, I want to create a new task so that I can track things I need to do. Acceptance criteria: A task form is available, required fields must be completed, and a newly created task appears in the task list after submission.


As a user, I want to view all my tasks in one place so that I can easily manage my workload. Acceptance criteria: The home screen displays only the logged-in user’s tasks and updates automatically after create, edit, or delete actions.


As a user, I want to edit an existing task so that I can update its details if things change. Acceptance criteria: The edit form is pre-filled with the task’s current data, changes are saved correctly, and the updated task is shown on the task list.


As a user, I want to mark a task as done so that I can track my progress. Acceptance criteria: A visible control allows toggling between To-Do and Done, and the updated status is immediately reflected in the task list.


As a user, I want to delete a task so that I can permanently remove completed or unwanted items. Acceptance criteria: The delete option is available on each task, and confirmed deletion permanently removes the task from the database and task list.


As a user, I want to receive a confirmation before deleting a task so that I do not delete tasks accidentally. Acceptance criteria: A confirmation screen or message appears before deletion and provides options to confirm or cancel the action.


As a user, I want the app to work smoothly on my mobile phone so that I can manage tasks on the go. Acceptance criteria: The layout adapts to mobile screens, buttons are easy to tap, and no horizontal scrolling is required.






Progressive Web App (PWA) User Stories
As a user, I want to install the app on my phone home screen so that it feels like a native mobile app. Acceptance criteria: The app provides a valid manifest file, displays an install prompt on supported devices, and launches in standalone mode when opened from the home screen.


As a user, I want the app to load even when my internet connection is unstable so that I can always access my task list. Acceptance criteria: Core app pages and static assets are cached by a service worker and load successfully when offline.
